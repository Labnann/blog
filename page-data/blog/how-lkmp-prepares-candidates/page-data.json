Because getting acquainted with a\nnew project is tough as they are pretty large and combine years of\nworks.But here in LKMP, I got to send my first patch to production\nAKA upstream kernel before I even started. The Linux kernel is the\nbiggest software project on the planet with over 25 million lines of\ncode. So how does Linux Kernel Mentorship Program do this?</p>\n<p>To select the candidate, they give them several tasks to complete. But\nunlike anywhere else, they give enough resource materials to learn\nand complete the tasks at the same time. This learning phase covers\nmany important beginner kernel developers guide. So the candidates\nwho complete the learning phase are almost ready to hack the kernel.</p>\n<p>To say generally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly learn how build the project.</li>\n<li>Then they teach how to change a small part of the project.</li>\n<li>Then teach how to create a new working module.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these learned, candidates are already knowledgeable about where\n\"things start\" and \"things end\". Then the mentors encourage the\ncandidates to: fix some documentation or work on test cases. Fixing\ndocumentation or tests requires research and the candidate is sort\nof forced to apply themselves to look into the code to understand the\nintention of a code. Therefore the candidate gets to send their\nfirst patch (git diff) to the community before even getting accepted\ninto LKMP. And thus they get hands on experience on development\nprocess and if the patch is good enough, it gets accepted too.</p>\n<p>Yes, implementing the process I described up there is not very hard.\nThis not only efficiently tests candidates if they have the correct\nskills for the work, but also gives them flavor of their work. Which\nin turns make them curious, confident, passionate and eventually\nthey contribute in the project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Kernel Mentorship Program: How They Prepared Me For Kernel Development Before I Even Got Accepted","date":"August 25, 2022","description":"There is a general belief, that in an internship, unless it is long you will spend your time learning ..."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/my-experience2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Kernel Bug Fixing - My Experience"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab8e7292-c5be-5488-b316-dc417e9de37b","previousPostId":"b689ebf8-9da6-5e42-87a2-86b65da0a640","nextPostId":"b06cbabd-5204-5134-a8da-e7fb04db78a4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
